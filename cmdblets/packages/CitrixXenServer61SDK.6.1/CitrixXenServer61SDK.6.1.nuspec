    <description>.NET wrapper for the XenServer 6.1 API. XenServer includes a XML-RPC based API, providing programmatic access to the extensive set of XenServer management features and tools. The XenServer API can be called from a remote system as well as local to the XenServer host. Remote calls are generally made securely over HTTPS, using port 443.
        There are five SDKs available, one for each of C, C#, Java, PowerShell, and Python. These are provided under an open-source license (LGPL or GPL with the common linking exception). This allows use (unmodified) in both closed-and open-source applications.</description>
